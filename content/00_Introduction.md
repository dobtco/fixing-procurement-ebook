#Introduction

In 2009, I was director of Sunlight Labs at the Sunlight Foundation -- a group of developers that worked on open government projects at the federal level. At the same time, Barack Obama had just been elected to his first term, and announced the American Reinvestment and Recovery act -- a multi-billion dollar "bailout" of the American economy. 

Along with the act, a website was to be created that allowed for citizens to oversee how this recovery money was being spent in order to "combat waste, fraud and abuse." And as the leader of one of the most sophisticated transparency technology organizations in the country, I thought that this website wasn't just something that would be smart to keep an eye on, it might be something smart for us to bid on and work on.

So I set up an open source, community bid for the project. I got a wiki running, and we went through the RFP line by line to come up with a compelling bid on how we would solve the problem. The 20 or so of us inside of Sunlight, along with dozens of volunteers crafted a bid that came to about $400,000. Taking into account that this was work that would require lots of overhead, I doubled the project price to $800,000, and sent it in. 

After sending it in, I felt nervous about cranking up the price that high. It seemed like a huge amount of money to charge for what needed to be done considering how many experts we had on-staff that could craft a great website for this kind of thing almost in their spare time!

Recovery.gov ended up costing $19 Million dollars. We at Sunlight, were not even eligible to bid on the contract, so we, perhaps the nation's leading experts on web-based transparency projects like Recovery.gov, did not even make it to the first round in the bidding process.

That was my first experience with government procurement. And it is when I started talking about it as something I thought needed changes.

Three years later, the White House called. They were setting up a "Presidential Innovation Fellowship" and wanted to work on ways to get new companies into government contracting. And they wanted me to lead a team of people to do that. It'd take six months, but the goals were clear: find ways to reduce cost, increase competition, and increase the level of talent.

My team included Adam Becker (now my partner at the Department of Better Technology) and Jed Wood, both strong developers. Like me, they had never been immersed into this space, but were frustrated by it. Government, after all, is a place where programmers can use their skills to have huge affects on society at large. 

The project we shipped was called RFP-EZ, and it does three things:

1. Makes it easy for government to write RFPs that people could understand and got great results.

2. Makes it easy for people to find those RFPs, and to bid on them.

3. Makes it easy for government to sort through the responses to that RFP and select the best one.

We worked through the federal bureaucracy over six months, and shipped a product as a pilot. It took five projects, and ran them through both the normal process, and through this new, RFP-EZ process so we could compare the bids and outcomes.

The result? Bids through RFP-EZ were 30% lower than through the normal means. With just these five projects, government enlarged its small business pool by 250 new businesses. The bids came in faster, and there were more of them, and the bids on-average, tended to vary less (possibly because of well-written RFPs) than through the normal way.

The United States Federal Government isn't the only organization with a "procurement problem." Every large enterprise needs help figuring out how best to engage with external suppliers. And now that we are starting the Department of Better Technology, we thought we'd share the lessons we learned from RFP-EZ. The following essays are a collection of ideas from our experience: what we did, the mistakes we made, and the things we think need changing.
